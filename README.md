Features:
The user can create an account and then modify their name, email address and password.  There is a forgot password option if they are stuck at the login window.
Once in, the user can create and join a organisation or just join an existing.
They can edit any organisation while they are not joined to one.  If they are they can only edit that one.
They can create, edit and delete shifts for anyone in the same oganisation.

Todo: (This would be the order in which I would complete these)

2. Filtering old shifts

3. Overtime
